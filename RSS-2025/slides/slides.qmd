## Context {.theme-slide2}

-   ðŸ”… `data.table` is an extremely popular R package for **dataset
    manipulation** and **summarizing** 

-   ðŸ”… **NSF Grant 1005559** (Pathways to Open-Source Ecosystems)

-   "Supports the facilitation, creation and growth of open-source
    ecosystems for the creation of new technology solutions."

-   ðŸ”… My role: community building, documentation and education,
    governance and sustainability

## Relevance {.theme-section3 .center}

## R is dying? Not even close... {.theme-slide2}

![](./images/tiobe.png)

(Ranked #14 in 2025; near-tie with e.g. Perl, SQL, PHP, Matlab)

## Where is R cutting edge? {.theme-slide2}

-   ðŸ”… Packages for **specific statistical models**

-   ðŸ”… Readable and **beginner-friendly** data wrangling with the
    `tidyverse`

-   ðŸ”… Speedy **in-memory data manipulation** with `data.table`

-   ðŸ”… Communities of **domain-specific** packages

## Resources {.theme-section3 .center}

## How the sausage gets made

-   ðŸ”… R is maintained by the **R Core Group**, a team of 20
    developers...

-   ... **none of these people are paid for their work.**

-   ðŸ”… Large donations to the [R
    Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/) have supported R
    Core in the past.

-   ðŸ”… The [R Contributor Working
    Group](https://contributor.r-project.org/working-group.html) is
    helping build a [Contributor
    Community](https://contributor.r-project.org/)

## What about packages?

-   ðŸ”… The `tidyverse` and `tidymodels` sets are maintained by **paid
    developers** at Posit, PBC.

-   ðŸ”… Sometimes, funding can come from:

    -   temporary public or private grants
    -   companies that allow employee "creative time"
    -   companies that release their internal work openly

-   ... but **almost all** of what you use is made by **community
    members** with no compensation.
