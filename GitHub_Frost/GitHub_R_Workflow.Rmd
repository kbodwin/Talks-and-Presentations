# Baby's First Repo

GitHub Desktop

* File > New Repository

* Choose a good name.  (No `_` allowed, use `-`.)

* Brief description.

* Choose your directory

* Defaults OK for now
    + (If you are going to share this code publicly, MIT license is a good choice.)
    
* Click "Create Repository"

* Push!

# Quiz

## What should we put in that repository first?

class: center, middle

# Quiz

## What should we put in that repository first?

## An **R Project**!!!

(From "Version Control" - your new repo.)

---

# Testing your repository

1. Open your R Project.

2. Create an R Markdown file and save it.

3. In your top right pane, is there a "Git" panel?
    + If not, raise your hand so we can help!
    
4. Check the box next to your Markdown file.

5. Click "commit" and fill out a message.

6. Push.

7. Navigate to "www.github.com/yourname/reponame" to see the results!

# Cloning

GitHub Desktop:

* File > Clone Repository

* URL tab

* "hglanz/rworkshop"

* Choose your directory

* Go!

## Now you have your own copy of the materials!  You can make changes, commit, and push.

# Everything is a Package

---
# Pre-setup

Install the packages `usethis`, `testthat`, and `roxygen2`.

---

# What is a package?

Technically, R recognizes **any** folder as a package if it has:

* A `DESCRIPTION` file

* A `NAMESPACE` file

* A folder called `R\`

Let's make one now...

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## DO NOT COPY PASTE THIS CODE!  You need a real path.

usethis::create_package("your/path/testpackage/")
```

---

# DESCRIPTION

Click on the `DESCRIPTION` file.  What information does it contain?

Let's make a package for our new exciting project on analyzing Irises.  Our goal is to find out the mean sizes for each iris.  Fill out some of the fields in the `DESCRIPTION` file accordidngly.

---

# NAMESPACE

**DO NOT EDIT THIS ONE!**  

We'll come back to it.

---

# R

Predictably, `R/` is the folder that will hold all your R files.  

Make a new R script called "get_mean.R". This function should take two arguments: a dataset, and the name of a column. It should return the mean of that column.

---

# Testing

Run the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_test("get_mean")
```

* What changed in your package folder?

* Follow along with me to create the test.

---

# Build the package

Run `ctrl-shift-b`.  What happened?

Run `ctrl-shift-t`.  What happened?

---
# Dependencies

Run the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_package("dplyr")
```

What changed in your packages folder?


---

# Documentation

Type `?get_mean`.  What happens?

Open up your `get_mean.R` file.

At the very top, above the function definition, type:

```
#' Finds the mean of a column.
```

Run `ctrl-shift-d`

* What changed in your folder?

---

# Documentation

Run `ctrl-shift-b`

Type `?get_mean`

What do you see?

Open your `NAMESPACE` file.

What changed?

---

# Documentation

Follow along with me, or mimic this example, to add to the documentation.

```
#' Add together two numbers.
#' 
#' @param x A number.
#' @param y A number.
#' @return The sum of \code{x} and \code{y}.
#' @examples
#' add(1, 1)
#' add(10, 1)
add <- function(x, y) {
  x + y
}
```

---

# Check-in:  Why???

* If you change `get_mean.R`, you can easily make sure that everything still works how you want it to.

* Easily remind yourself what the point of `get_mean.R` was.

* If you share your work, things are in a predictable structure.

* Easier to construct your analyses...

---

# But I'm a Data Scientist, not a Developer!!!

--
Me too! (Until recently)
-- 
I wish someone had taught me packaging. :(

---

# Let's analyze some data!

Run the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_build_ignore("my_analysis")
```

* What changed in your package folder?

* Why do you think this was important?

---
# Let's analyze some data!

Open an Markdown file, and save it in the `my_analysis` folder.

In your second setup chunk, include this line

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(testpackage)
```
--
But wait!  We didn't ever `install.packages` it!
--
`ctrl-shift-b` installed it for you.... but it is only available to you right now.

(It's possible to install/share from GitHub)

---
# Irises are so exciting

Make a new R chunk with the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
iris %>%
  select(-Species) %>%
  map(get_mean)
```

Knit your file... did it work?

---
# If we have time:

Turn your "colleges" analysis into an R Package that is hosted on GitHub.

---

# Takeaway messages: GitHub

* ALL your coding-related projects should be GitHub repos!

* (Data can be on GitHub, but often not a good idea.)

* Join the community. <3

---

# Takeaway messages: Packages

* Takes some getting used to, but makes your life easier.

* `usethis::create_package("path")` to make basic version.

* Don't touch `DESCRIPTION` or `NAMESPACE`, unless you are truly developing something to publicise.

* Put all your functions in `.R` files in the `R/` folder.

* `usethis::use_test("function")` to automatically make unit tests

* `usethis::use_build_ignore("foldername")` to make folders for your analyses and so forth.

* `ctrl-shift-d` to make documentation

* `ctrl-shift-l` to load changes.

* `ctrl-shift-t` to re-run tests

* `ctrl-shift-b` to build package
